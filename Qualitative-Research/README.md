### Exploring Pluralistic Ignorance (PI): A Qualitative Research Journey 

In the realm of psychology, I embarked on an independent research project, utilizing my data analysis skills to delve into the intriguing concept of PI. This project emerged from a desire to unravel the complexities of this subject matter in terms of analysis. 

Qualitative research, distinct from its quantitative counterpart, presents unique challenges, often requiring the transformation of qualitative data into quantitative insights. This undertaking marked a significant milestone in my data analysis journey, providing me with valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in this field. Furthermore, it also expanding my proficiency in R statistical analysis. I utilized a wide range of packages to effectively analyze and interpret the data, enriching my skill set. The culmination of this project was marked by the presentation of my findings through public poster presentations


#### Research Abstract
Gender bias has been a social construct for centuries. Despite the progress that has been made toward egalitarianism, it remains pervasive in society. The phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance (PI) has been under study relating to this topic, and studies suggest that men tend to be pluralistically ignorant about gender bias (e.g., Sobotka, 2020). PI is a term used to describe people’s misperceptions of the norm and their belief that their views are contrary to that norm. Expanding from these studies, we examined the PI of the average male and female and correlated these perceptions to their beliefs regarding sexism. To explore these variables, we used novel measures involving misogynistic hypothetical scenarios to determine participants’ personal beliefs on gender bias and their opinions regarding the beliefs of the average person. We hypothesized that people who score higher on PI will score higher on sexist attitudes and that men will exhibit higher values for both. The results of this study can help us understand the effects of PI in society and move toward finding solutions to mitigate sexist attitudes. If the results suggest a correlation between PI and sexist attitudes, then it indicates that creating awareness about perceived norms and correcting misperceptions can help diminish sexist attitudes in society.
