# Data Analytics in Python
### Covid-19 and the English Premier League (EPL)

The Coronaviurs pandemic impacted the sports industry as much as it devestasted the world. The English Premier League was no exception and it being one of the biggest leagues in the world, it was hugely impacted by Covid-19. Not only did it cause huge financial losses but it also affected the momentum of games.

In this analysis, we will look deeper into the impact Covid-19 had on EPL matches. We will specifically look at how the absense of fans affected games during the 2019/20 season when Covid-19 first hit, and when only home fans were allowed to return during the 2020/21 season. To look into these research ideas, we will look at different game attributes like winning & scoring percentages, corners & shots, total points, etc and compare them over four seasons.

The project presents a comprehensive overview of data analytics, encompassing meticulous steps ranging from data cleansing and processing to transformations, thorough data analysis, and impactful visualizations. These steps were conducted to explore the research topics and highlight the resulting insights.
