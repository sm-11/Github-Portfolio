The English Premier League was no exception and it being one of the biggest leagues in the world, it was hugely impacted by Covid-19. Not only did it cause huge financial losses but it also affected the momentum of games.\n\nIn this analysis, we will look deeper into the impact Covid-19 had on matches. We will specifically look at how the absense of fans affected games during the 2019/20 season when Covid-19 first hit, and when only home fans were allowed to return during the 2020/21 season.\nTo look into these research ideas, we will look at different game attributes like winning & scoring percentages, corners & shots, total points, etc and compare them over the following four seasons:\n\n*** 2018/19 Season**\n\n*** 2019/20 Season**\n\n*** 2020/21 Season**\n\n*** 2021/22 Season**\n\nThese four seasons were chosen because two of the seasons (i.e., 2019/20 & 2020/21 seasons) were the seasons that were impacted by Covid-19 while the 2018/19 and the 2021/22 seasons are used for comparision (i.e., before and after Covid-19).\n\nThe other points to note for this analysis include the dates of the Premier League's  suspension and return. EPL games were suspended on ***March 13, 2020*** and resumed on ***June 17, 2020*** to play without the attendance of any fans for the rest of the season. Home fans were allowed to return on all grounds beginning ***May 17, 2021*** but away fans could not attend because of travel restrictions. The 2021/22 season began with the attendance of all fans.
