# Natural Language Processing in Python
### Predicting NSTEM's LinkedIn Post-Performace

This project was designed with the aim of enhancing predictive capabilities within the social media analytics department at an organization called NSTEM. During my internship with their analytics department, I recognized the potential to leverage their existing data resources to contribute to their goal of increasing their social media footprint. 

The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that can determine optimal content types for improving audience outreach and engagement. To achieve this goal, I utilized Natural Language Processing tools and employed supervised learning techniques for in-depth analysis, training, and the subsequent attainment of results.
