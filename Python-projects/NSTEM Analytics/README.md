# Natural Language Processing in Python
### 

This project was designed to help make useful predictions for the social media analytics department for an organization (NSTEM). As an intern in their analytics department, I saw an opportunity to utilize their previous data to achieve the goal of making better social media posts to capture more audience as well as tailor their content towards their audience. 
This project was designed with the aim of enhancing predictive capabilities within the social media analytics department at organization NSTEM. During my internship in their analytics department, I recognized the potential to leverage their existing data resources to contribute to their goal of increasing their social media footprint. 

The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that can determine optimal content types for improving audience outreach and engagement. To achieve this goal, I utilized Natural Language Processing tools and employed supervised learning techniques for in-depth analysis, training, and the subsequent attainment of results.
