# Resilience and Covid-19 Lockdowns 
### Machine Learing in Python

The objective of this project is to offer an insightful exploration of the impact of lockdowns on mental health. The reason for this inquiry stems from the unprecedented rise in mental health issues triggered by the Coronovirus pandemic. While it is recognized that various factors contribute to this surge, the focus here is on investigating the interplay between predisposition and mental disorders. This analysis aims to shed light on whether individuals with specific personality traits exhibit greater mental resilience in the face of significant environmental stressors, in this case lockdowns.

The project incorporates a comprehensive array of methodologies, including advanced preprocessing techniques, feature selection algorithms, neural network models, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter optimization processes, to construct a predictive machine learning model. The model predicts people's resilience towards mental distress (i.e., stress, anxiety, & depression) during pandemic lockdowns using the Big-4 personality traits (i.e., Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness & Conscientiousness).
