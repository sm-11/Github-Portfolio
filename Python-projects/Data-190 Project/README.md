# Resilience and Covid-19 Lockdowns

Created a predictive model that predicts people's resilience towards mental distress (i.e., stress, anxiety, & depression) during pandemic lockdowns using the Big-4 personality traits (i.e., Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness & Conscientiousness)

This project showcases the use of preprocessing techniques, feature selection algorithms, neural network algorithms, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter optimizations to build the model.
