# Data Analysis in Tableau and Python
### AXS National Collegiate Sports Analytics Championship Final Round

A competition for seniors and graduate students to showcase their analytical capabilities in the sports industry through the analysis of basketball datasets. The mission: craft a compelling five-minute presentation showcasing analytical, visualization, and communication prowess. There are two rounds to the competition, the virtual preliminaries which determine the seeding for and the in-person final event. In a tight timeframe, participants meticulously analyze the released dataset and craft a presentation slated for delivery to esteemed analytics professionals hailing from prominent organizations such as the NBA and the PGA Tour.

The project centered around utilizing Python for data cleaning and Tableau for the analysis. This experience greatly enhanced my data analysis skills in the realm of sports and contributed to our team's achievement of second place, representing our college nationally.
