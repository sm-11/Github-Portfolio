# Sammies Demographic Data Analysis Project
### Sammuel J. Heyman Service to America (Sammies) Awards Program

The objective of this expansive project was to conduct a comprehensive multi-analysis of large-scale datasets to higlight three key aspects. Firstly, the project assessed the representativeness of the Sammies program compared to previous year's nominees. Secondly, it examined the federal government's representativeness in relation to both past years and Sammies nominees. Lastly, the analysis gauged the overall representativeness of the federal government concerning the general population.

This multifaceted analysis was executed using extensive datasets, including FedScope, Census, and FEVS data. The analysis was facilitated by employing a range of tools such as Python, Tableau, and Power BI to ensure robust analyses and effectively communicate the findings.
