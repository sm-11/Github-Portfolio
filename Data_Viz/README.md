# Dashboards
As a collaborative team effort, we embarked on an extensive data analysis project leveraging Spotify's dataset. We designed an interactive and user-friendly dashboard aimed at identifying the essential elements that contribute to a song's quality. This involved a deep dive into metrics such as BPM, energy levels, decibel ratings, and song duration.

Our analysis centered on chart-toppers and long-standing favorites within Spotify's extensive library. The outcome is a sophisticated tool that provides users with a technical and comprehensive understanding of the factors that distinguish exceptional songs in the music industry
