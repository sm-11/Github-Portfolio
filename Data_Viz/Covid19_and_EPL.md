# Covid-19 and the English Premier League (EPL)

The Coronaviurs pandemic impacted the sports industry as much as it devestasted the world. The English Premier League was no exception and it being one of the biggest leagues in the world, it was hugely impacted by Covid-19. Not only did it cause huge financial losses but it also affected the momentum of games.

In this analysis, we will look deeper into the impact Covid-19 had on matches. We will specifically look at how the absense of fans affected games during the 2019/20 season when Covid-19 first hit, and when only home fans were allowed to return during the 2020/21 season. To look into these research ideas, we will look at different game attributes like winning & scoring percentages, corners & shots, total points, etc and compare them over the following four seasons 

* 2018/19 Season

* 2019/20 Season

* 2020/21 Season

* 2021/22 Season

These four seasons were chosen because two of the seasons (i.e., 2019/20 & 2020/21 seasons) were the seasons that were impacted by Covid-19 while the 2018/19 and the 2021/22 seasons are used for comparision (i.e., before and after Covid-19).

The other points to note for this analysis include the dates of the Premier League's suspension and return. EPL games were suspended on March 13, 2020 and resumed on June 17, 2020 to play without the attendance of any fans for the rest of the season. Home fans were allowed to return on all grounds beginning May 17, 2021 but away fans could not attend because of travel restrictions. The 2021/22 season began with the attendance of all fans.

Research questions:
1. How did fans attendance affect the outcome of games before & after Covid-19?
2. How did the absense of fans affect the outcome of games during Covid-19?
3. How did the return of home fans during the 2020/21 season affect the outcome of games?
