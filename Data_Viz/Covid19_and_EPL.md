# The Coronavirus Pandemic and the English Premier League (EPL)

The Coronaviurs pandemic impacted the sports industry as much as it devestasted the world. The English Premier League was no exception and it being one of the biggest leagues in the world, it was hugely impacted by Covid-19. Not only did it cause huge financial losses but it also affected the momentum of games.

This analysis specifically looked at how the absense of fans affected games during the 2019/20 season when Covid-19 first hit, and its effect when only home fans returned during the 2020/21 season. To look into these research ideas, different game attributes like winning and scoring percentages, corners, shots, and, total points were investigated and compared over four different consecutive seasons. 
* 2018/19 Season - pre-Covid season
* 2019/20 Season and 2020/21 Season - Covid seasons
* 2021/22 Season - post Covid season

Python was primarily used to conduct the data analysis and the results were then used to build dashboards and visuals to better interact the outcomes to audiences. [Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/selam8365/viz/Data-480_research/Viz_1)
