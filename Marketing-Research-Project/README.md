### Exploring Roanoke College Student Dining Satisfaction and Event Preferences

The purpose of this project was to gauge Roanoke College student satisfaction with campus and Salem, VA's dining choices, including preferences, locations, and food. We focused on assessing current demand and satisfaction, identifying areas for improvement, and exploring potential new dining options based on student preferences. 

The research specifically examined two separate areas: students dining experience at on-campus eateries versus around Salem, VA, and students on-campus event experience versus off-campus in Salem. The analysis of survey data and focus group discussions yielded valuable conclusions and recommendations, detailed in our report.
