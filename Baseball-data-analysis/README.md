The aim of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of Roanoke College's baseball data, delving into various facets of the study. We analyzed two distinct datasets to address separate research questions. The first challenge involved conducting hypothesis tests, while the second task necessitated the application of contingency tables and the usse of Chi-square tests. The compiled report can be found here.
