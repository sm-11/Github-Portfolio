# Descriptive Analytics
Conducted an in-depth analysis of Roanoke college's student retention data and the ever-changing landscape of home sale pricing in Salem, Virginia. This comprehensive study focused on two prominent issues: the phenomenon of students transferring out of our institution and the escalating prices of homes within our city.

Employing a range of robust statistical methodologies including diagnostic tests, data transformation techniques, stepwise regression, model optimization, multiple regression, and statistical inferences, I rigorously investigated these pressing concerns. This meticulous analysis allowed me to derive well-founded conclusions, shedding light on the factors influencing student retention and the dynamics of our local real estate market.
